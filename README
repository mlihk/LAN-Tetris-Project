Project background:
This project was created in 20/21 when I was 17/18. 
This game is all about an in-LAN 2-player Tetris game.
Using Python, sockets, and Pygame to run.

Requirements:
-Python Interpreter
-Pygame module
-Socket module

Gameplay:
There are 4 different modes to choose from.
1. Single-player mode, keep playing until game over and you will get a score for your performance.
2. Single-player mode, perform your best within a given time limit.
2. 2-Player mode, play against each other, first to 300 points wins
3. 2-Player mode, play against each other, the player with the highest point scored within a time limit wins.

How to play?
[Single player]
Click on the Single Player button in the interface and choose one of the two single-player game modes.
[Multiplayer]
Requires another machine/local machine but parallel runs two of this program at the same time

Future Possible Implmentations:
-Count-down timer for the game to start
-Better smoother interface
-Supports game mode with more than 2 players
